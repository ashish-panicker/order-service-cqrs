# Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) Pattern
**Overview**
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a software architecture pattern that separates read and write operations into distinct models. Instead of using a single model for both commands (write operations) and queries (read operations), CQRS divides them into two separate models:

- **Command Model:** Handles operations that modify data (Create, Update, Delete).
- **Query Model:** Handles operations that retrieve data (Read).

This separation allows better scalability, improved performance, and enhanced security.

----------

**Key Concepts of CQRS**

1. **Command Model (Write Model)**
    - Accepts commands that modify data.
    - Enforces business rules and validation.
    - Often interacts with the database in a transactional manner.
    - Uses domain models and aggregates to ensure consistency.
2. **Query Model (Read Model)**
    - Retrieves and returns data.
    - Optimized for fast read operations (can use caching, denormalized data, or NoSQL).
    - Does not modify data.
    - Can use different databases or projections optimized for read performance.
3. **Event Sourcing (Optional)**
    - Instead of directly updating the database, changes are stored as a sequence of events.
    - Events represent state changes and can be replayed to reconstruct the current state.
    - Works well with CQRS to maintain a reliable audit trail.

**How CQRS Works?**

1. **A user sends a command (e.g., "Create Order")** â†’ Processed by the Command Model.
2. **The Command Model validates and updates the database** â†’ Often triggers an event.
3. **The event updates the Read Model (Query Model)** â†’ Could be a separate database or an optimized structure.
4. **A user requests data (e.g., "Get Order Details")** â†’ Processed by the Query Model for fast retrieval.

**Benefits of CQRS**
âœ… **Scalability:** Reads and writes can be scaled independently.
âœ… **Performance Optimization:** Queries can use denormalized structures, caching, or different storage mechanisms.
âœ… **Improved Security:** Write operations can enforce stricter rules, while read operations can be exposed differently.
âœ… **Better Maintainability:** Separation of concerns makes the system easier to manage and evolve.
âœ… **Event Sourcing Support:** Helps in audit logging and reconstructing historical states.

----------

**Example Use Case: Order Management System**

- **Command Model:** Handles "Create Order," "Update Order," "Cancel Order."
- **Query Model:** Retrieves order details, order history, customer order list.
- **Data Storage:**
    - Write database: Stores normalized transactional data.
    - Read database: Stores precomputed views for fast retrieval.
----------

**When to Use CQRS?**
âœ… High read-to-write ratio applications (e.g., e-commerce, social media).
âœ… Systems requiring event sourcing and audit logs.
âœ… Large-scale applications with multiple read/write optimizations.
âœ… Microservices architecture where read and write services need to scale separately.
ðŸš« Avoid CQRS if the system is simple and doesnâ€™t need read/write separation, as it adds complexity.
